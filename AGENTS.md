# Project Law (AGENTS)

## Workflow
- Work is organized as: Phase → Milestone → Step.
- One Step = one diff = one commit.
- Always show `/diff` before commit.
- After pushing, stop and wait for review.

## Stack Lock
- TypeScript monorepo
- Next.js admin
- Node API + Worker
- Postgres + pgvector
- Redis + BullMQ
- S3-compatible storage
- Gmail API + Pub/Sub
- OpenAI Responses behind wrapper

## Change Control
- No stack changes without a Decision Record amendment.
